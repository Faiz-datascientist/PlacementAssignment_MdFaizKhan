    "As we know that the correlation between SAT scores and college GPAs is something around 0.7, the correlation is greater than 0.5 it's positively correlated, it indicates that the SAT was originally conceived with the intent of predicting college performance it shows that GPA college performance is much better than the SAT score, that's why SAT score is not taken seriously today.\n",

While there is a strong correlation between SAT scores and college GPA, it does not necessarily mean that SAT scores directly cause higher college GPAs. Other factors, such as study habits, motivation, and prior academic preparation, may also contribute to higher GPAs."
